Here are some of the most precious lessons I’ve learned over the years of traveling.</p><table class="e-rte-table" style="width: 100%; min-width: 0px;"><colgroup><col style="width: 50%;"><col style="width: 50%;"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td><img src="https://blog.her-healing-initiative.org/BlogContentImage_e482eccf-066f-4c5c-9e6d-1628900c5988_volcano.jpg" class="e-rte-image e-imginline" alt="volcano" width="602" height="402" style="min-width: 0px; max-width: 700px; min-height: 0px;">&nbsp;</td><td style="vertical-align: top;"><h2>Appreciation of diversity</h2><p>Getting used to an entirely different culture can be challenging. While it’s also nice to learn about cultures online or from books, nothing comes close to experiencing cultural diversity in person. You learn to appreciate each and every single one of the differences while you become more culturally fluid.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><br></p>
